== Getting Started with Vaadin Spring and Spring Boot

include::note.asciidoc[]

During this tutorial we will create a new Spring Boot project, add Vaadin and Vaadin Spring as dependencies, create a simple Spring UI and run the application.

=== Creating a Spring Boot project
The easiest way to get started is to go to http://start.spring.io and fill in the necessary details. Make sure you at least select Vaadin. The rest of the tutorial uses lambdas, so Java 8 is recommended but not required. Then download the generated project as a Maven Project and open it up in your favorite IDE.

Import the generated project into your IDE - if using Eclipse, use Import... -> Existing Maven Projects.

Now you can create your Vaadin UI. Create a new UI class in your project and annotate it with @SpringUI e.g. like this:

[source, java]
.MyUI.java
----
@SpringUI
public class MyVaadinUI extends UI {
    @Override
    protected void init(VaadinRequest vaadinRequest) {
        setContent(new Label("Hello! I'm the root UI!"));
    }
}
----

Run the main(String[]) method in the generated Application class and point your browser to http://localhost:8080 . Voila!

Further configuration of the Vaadin Spring application and alternatives to using Spring Boot will be covered in later tutorials. For the next steps, continue at link::injection.asciidoc[Injection and Scopes with Vaadin Spring].
